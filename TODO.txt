Notes for the future:

Revision history - future feature: Revision history handled via a external tool such as svn?, git, etc? 

No-db: Storing the entire dataset in xml on disk? 
<suite>
  <id></id>
  <account_id></account_id>
  <name></name>
  <description></description>
  <suites>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
  </suites>
</suite>

Test suites: - Deletion: We would need to write a dependency removal system. Would rather have this as disable at best.
Tests: - Deletion: Same issue as Test Suites.

Integrations with:
- QTP, SilkTest, Selenium, Junit, Webload, TestComplete
