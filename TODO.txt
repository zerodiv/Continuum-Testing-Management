Build plan:

Test runner:
  - Extract the available params from the test and collate them for the test. (A little R&D with selenium required here).
  - Document the concepts around single session variable tracking for testing suites.

Test Lab:
  - create phone home app to configure a available node for use (.net for the windows stuff)
   * CTM-ET - Phone home on a heartbeat basis, provides the basics for us to track health on the
     test node also (if we want), right now I will settle for checking in and disabling of a node
     upon no checkin
  - create session tracker
  - create runnner

Accounts Admin:
- manage accounts
- update / change password 
- delete (disable)

Moderation:
- approve / denial queue

Runtime Operation:
- .net job on host to maintain browsers: kill running away ones, etc
- .mac job on host to maintain browsers: kill running away ones, etc

Notes for the future:

Revision history - future feature: Revision history handled via a external tool such as svn?, git, etc? 

No-db: Storing the entire dataset in xml on disk? 
<suite>
  <id></id>
  <account_id></account_id>
  <name></name>
  <description></description>
  <suites>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
  </suites>
</suite>

Test suites: - Deletion: We would need to write a dependency removal system. Would rather have this as disable at best.
Tests: - Deletion: Same issue as Test Suites.

Integrations with:
- QTP, SilkTest, Selenium, Junit, Webload, TestComplete
