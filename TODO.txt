Known bugs:
- Test comments for tests are being lost currently - DomDocument is losing them / it's choosing to not let me see them.
  Need to think of a way to get around this without reinventing the wheel. XmlReader seems like the right solution, but
  will need a fair amount of work for us to actually use it and it also has 'issues' with malformed xml.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Build plan:

CTM Agent Testing:
 - addSelection
 - clickAndWait
 - click
 - doubleClick
 - controlKeyDown
 - controlKeyUp
 - focus
 - open
 - select
 - selectWindow
 - store
 - type
 - typeAndWait
 - waitForPageToLoad
 - verifyTextPresent
*test the new features that we added in*
 - session carry over between tests
 - store
 - store + javascript
 - store variable carry over between tests

Folders:
 - add 
 - edit
 - user folder: Make this available to the admin and qa folks
 - remove: Make this move the tests and suites into the users folder.
 - move: Allow admin / qa users to move a test or test suite.

Moderation:
 - approve / denial queue: This might be covered via the suites/tests pages.

Deletion:
 - soft delete tests
 - soft delete suites

Test Runs:
 - Scheduling a test run against a machine / browser needs to be forked such that there is either
   a automated cycle.
 - "Run Again" button. To reschedule a suite with the same settings, etc.

Test runner:
 - Move the register / ask for work cycle into a single service call. Clean up the 
   in and out xml processing while there.
 - There is no iteration support right now.

Test runner pre-req:
 - Document the concepts around single session variable tracking for testing suites.

Runtime Operation:
 - Need to add a password / security to phone home system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO Before Public Release:

License: 
 - GPL/MPL?

Installer:
 - needs to determine php requirements
 - needs to determine mysql requirements
 - write config to etc/config.ini
 - self destruct upon writing to config

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes/plans for the future:

Phar files:
  - Need to look at possibly using a phar build system as a post 5.3 release item.

Schema refactor: 
  - need to review this again with perf in mind, we think it will scale to very
    large test numbers, but we need to run in a bigger dataset to prove this.
  - indexes

Integrations with:
- QTP, SilkTest, Selenium, Junit, Webload, TestComplete
- We can accomplish this via different builders, and possibly re-thinking our creation scheme here
