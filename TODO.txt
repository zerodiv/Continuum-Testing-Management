Build plan:

  - test_param = drop (yes?) - so far not needing it since test_command has most of the data needed. Eval after we're
    done with the test_runner.

Test Lab:
  - build out test_suite_param
  - modify suite editor to save test_params into test_suite_param enabling the test_run builder to be faster
  - build out test_run
  - build out test_run_state
  - build out test_run_type
  - build out test_run_log (TODO: Schema for this - would like to not store it all raw in the db - but for now meh)
  - create test runnner
  - create session tracker
  - create phone home app to configure a available node for use (.net for the windows stuff)
   * CTM-ET - Phone home on a heartbeat basis, provides the basics for us to track health on the
     test node also (if we want), right now I will settle for checking in and disabling of a node
     upon no checkin


Accounts Admin:
- manage accounts
- update / change password 
- delete (disable)

Moderation:
- approve / denial queue

Runtime Operation:
- .net job on host to maintain browsers: kill running away ones, etc
- .mac job on host to maintain browsers: kill running away ones, etc

Installer:
- needs to determine php requirements
- needs to determine mysql requirements
- write config to etc/config.ini
- self destruct upon writing to config

Test runner pre-req:
  - Document the concepts around single session variable tracking for testing suites.

Notes/plans for the future:

Schema refactor: 
  - need to review this again with perf in mind, we think it will scale to very
    large test numbers, but we need to run in a bigger dataset to prove this.

Revision history - future feature: Revision history handled via a external tool such as svn?, git, etc? 

No-db: Storing the entire dataset in xml on disk? 
<suite>
  <id></id>
  <account_id></account_id>
  <name></name>
  <description></description>
  <suites>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
  </suites>
</suite>

Test suites: - Deletion: We would need to write a dependency removal system. Would rather have this as disable at best.
Tests: - Deletion: Same issue as Test Suites.

Integrations with:
- QTP, SilkTest, Selenium, Junit, Webload, TestComplete

-- Misc RC notes:
We can pass a specific hardcode to browser path on selenium rc:
*custom <path to browser>

Will most likely use at for managing the various jobs needed to run the test in parallel.

-- Basic notes about session variables:
* ctm_(action)_(variable)
* ctm_input_variable - Takes a variable from the running test session and places it into the selenium test.
* ctm_output_variable - Takes a variable from the running test session and places it into the test runner session.
* ctm_clear_variable - Removes a variable from the running test session.
* ctm_clear_all - Removes all variables from the running test session.

-- Need to add a password / security to phone home system.
