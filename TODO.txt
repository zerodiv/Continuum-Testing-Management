Build plan:

Windows App:
  - download test run
  - run test run
  - report back to home base results
  - .net job on host to maintain browsers: kill running away ones, etc

General Features:
  - pagnation object need a pagnaitor that works with the selectors to move back and forth through
    a given set.

Accounts Admin:
  - manage accounts
  - update / change password 
  - delete (disable)

Moderation:
- approve / denial queue

Installer:
- needs to determine php requirements
- needs to determine mysql requirements
- write config to etc/config.ini
- self destruct upon writing to config

Test runner pre-req:
  - Document the concepts around single session variable tracking for testing suites.

Runtime Operation:
- .mac job on host to maintain browsers: kill running away ones, etc

Notes/plans for the future:

Schema refactor: 
  - need to review this again with perf in mind, we think it will scale to very
    large test numbers, but we need to run in a bigger dataset to prove this.

    Need table locking...
    Need transactions...
    Need foreign key restrictions...

Revision history - future feature: Revision history handled via a external tool such as svn?, git, etc? 

No-db: Storing the entire dataset in xml on disk? At this point I want to skip this, but perhaps I will
revisit it as part of the revision history concept.
<suite>
  <id></id>
  <account_id></account_id>
  <name></name>
  <description></description>
  <suites>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
      <suite id="n"></suite>
  </suites>
</suite>

Test suites: - Deletion: We would need to write a dependency removal system. Would rather have this as disable at best.
Tests: - Deletion: Same issue as Test Suites.

-- Need to add a password / security to phone home system.

-- Tests require a base url to root themselves to. If we context seneitive the suites we will be locking ourselves
into a suite cannot span multiple sites. Ideally we would like to be able to test edge cases where we have single
sign on or other functionality based in logging into multiple sites via single auth credentials. 

Integrations with:
- QTP, SilkTest, Selenium, Junit, Webload, TestComplete
- We can accomplish this via different builders, and possibly re-thinking our creation scheme here
